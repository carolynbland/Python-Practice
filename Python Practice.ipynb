    "* **Population vs Sample:** A population is the total property of interest over the area of interest whereas a sample is a set of values and locations that have been measured \n",
    "* **Qualitative vs Quantitative:** qualitative is a feature that requires interpretation whereas quantitative is a feature you can measure directly \n",
    "* **Estimation vs Simulation:** An estimation is a statistical model for local accuracy whereas a simulation is a statistical model for global accuracy \n",
    "* **Prediction vs Inference:** Prediction is predicting the sample from a given model of the population whereas an inference is describing the population given a sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:green\">Types of Statistics </span>\n",
    "* **Inferential Statistics:** given a random sample from a population, describe the population\n",
    "> E.g. given the well(s) samples, describe the reservoir \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictive Statistics:** predict the samples given assumptions about the population \n",
    "> Given our model of the reservoir, predict the next well (pre-drill assessment) sample, e.g. porosity, permeability, production rate etc\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:green\">Basic Definitions </span>\n",
    "* Deterministic Model: Assumes the system or process that is completely predictable \n",
    "> Engineering and geoscience physics and expert judgement \n",
    "> E.g. interpretation of 3D seismic data, physics-based flow modeling \n",
    "> Advantages: Integration of physics and expert knowledge, integration of various information sources \n",
    "> Disadvantages: often quite time consuming, often no assessment of uncertainty, focus on building one model \n",
    "* Statistical Model: system or process that is uncertain, multiple models constrained by statistics \n",
    "> Data-driven, machine learning \n",
    "> E.g. Data-drive, geostatistics, machine learning \n",
    "> Advantages: speed, uncertainty assessment, report significance and confidence intervals, honor many types of data, data-driven approaches \n",

    "#### Types of Statistical Models:\n",
    "* Estimation\n",
    "> Process of obtaining the single best value of a reservoir property at an unsampled location \n",
    "> Local accuracy takes precedence over global spatial variability \n",
    "> Too ‘smooth’, not appropriate for forecasting \n",

    "> Process of obtaining one or more good values of a reservoir property at an unsampled location \n",
    "> Global accuracy, matches the global statistics \n",
    "> Simulation methods tend to produce more realistic property distributions \n",
    "> Preferred because we can capture full distributions of properties of interest, the extremes matter and we need realistic models for flow simulation \n",

    "Transfer Function: Calculation applied to the model (deterministic or statistical) to calculate a decision criterion (maps 3D subsurface model to a decision criteria, brings data to something you can make a decision on)\n",

    "-\tRealizations: hold input parameters constant and change random number seed \n",
    "-\tScenarios: change the input parameters or other modeling choices \n",
    "-\tReservoir modeling uncertainty process 1) integrate all available information and build multiple scenarios and realizations to sample the uncertainty space 2) apply all models to transfer function to map a decision criteria 3) Assemble the distribution of the decision criteria 4) Make the best decision accounting for this uncertainty model \n",

    "#### Types of Data\t\n",
    "* Hard data: the data that has a high degree of certainty, usually based on a direct measurement \n",
    "> E.g. well core and log based porosity, lithofacies assessed from well logs \n",
    "* Soft data: data that provides indirect measures of the property of interest with a significant degree of uncertainty \n",
    "> E.g. probability density function for local porosity calibrated from acoustic impedance \n",
    "* Primary data: the variable of interest and target for building a model \n",
    "> E.g. porosity measures from cores and logs used to build a full 3D porosity model \n",
    "* Secondary Data: another variable/feature that provides information about the primary data through a relationship/calibration \n",
    "> E.g. acoustic impedance to support modeling porosity and porosity to support modeling permeability \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describing Data\t\n",
    "* Coverage: Volume of covered by all the samples of this type of data what proportion of the reservoir/population has this data available typically? \n",
    "> E.g. a couple meters around wells \n",
    "* Scale/Support Size: scale of the individual sample measurements. what is the scale of the individual data measures? \n",
    "> E.g. pore scale \n",
    "* Information Type: type of information from this type of data. what does the data tell us about the subsurface? \n",
    "> E.g. grain size, fluid type \n",
    "* Resolution: ratio between the maximum signal measured to the smallest part that can be resolved or smallest change that can be measured (the scale of the individual sample measurements) \n",
